## Performing Text Segmentation to Improve OCR on Multi Scene Text

Best paper award winning paper in 5th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Speech Technology (AIST-2023)

A new first-of-its-kind annotated dataset called OCRSBT for digital text segmentation is proposed in this work, along with a novel pre-processing pipeline using deep learning that 
performs text retrieval from images having varying and complex backgrounds using binary semantic segmentation. With quantitative metrics such as the DICE coefficient as high as 99.56%, 
the qualitative performance improvement of OCR has also been validated on real-world test samples containing varying contextual information to validate the modelâ€™s efficacy. 
Ablation experiments are also performed to determine the importance of superresolution of input images using Stable Diffusion and ESRGAN.
